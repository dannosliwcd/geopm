# Testing for the GEOPM Service

This directory provides a set of integration test scripts showing
examples of interacting with the GEOPM service using a variety of
command line tools including `geopmaccess`, `geopmread`, and
`geopmwrite`.

These tests are written in Bash and Python, and serve the purpose of
testing a fully installed GEOPM service using only software from the
service subdirectory of the GEOPM reposistory.  The tests in this
directory also show examples of how to use each of the features
provided by the service.  The tests each begin with a long comment
describing the feature under test, and provide a form of tutorial for
an end user learning how to interact with the GEOPM service.


## Test Setup

The integration tests require a system-wide installation of the GEOPM
service.  This is typically done by installing the GEOPM RPM packages.
Running the following commands will create the GEOPM Service RPM files
from the GEOPM source code repository.

```bash
cd geopm/service
./autogen.sh
./configure
make rpm
```

The RPM files are created with the `rpmbuild` command.  Unless
otherwise configured, the `rpmbuild` command creates RPMs in the
location: `${HOME}/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64`.  To install these files and
start the GEOPM service, the
`geopm/service/integration/install_service.sh` script may be used.
This script may be run in the `geopm/service` directory by issuing the
following command:

```bash
cd geopm/service
sudo integration/install_service.sh $(cat VERSION) ${USER}
```

Note that the `VERSION` file is created in the `geopm/service`
directory when the `autogen.sh` script is run.  Once the GEOPM Service
is installed, the access lists must be updated to enable the tests.
The following commands may be issued to allow any user to access all
signals and controls:

```bash
geopmaccess -a | sudo geopmaccess -w
geopmaccess -a -c | sudo geopmaccess -w -c
```

## How to Run the Tests

Each of the entry points for the integration tests is a script of the
form:

    geopm/integration/test/test_*.sh

Some of these tests require root privileges unless the sudoers file
has been setup to allow some privileged commands to be run without
full sudo access (see below for more information).  These tests have
names of the form:

    geopm/integration/test/test_su_*.sh

The tests are setup to run as the user specified in the
${GEOPM_TEST_USER} environment variable.  If the variable is not
specified the tests will run as the "test-service" user.

If the test finishes with an exit code of `0`, and it prints `SUCCESS`
at the end, then the test has succeeded.

A limited set of root privileges may be used by non-root users by
installing the helper scripts

    geopm/service/integration/check_session_clean.sh
    geopm/service/integration/get_batch_server.py
    geopm/service/integration/install_service.sh
    geopm/service/integration/kill_geopmd.sh
    geopm/service/integration/test/.libs/test_batch_perf (only available after `make checkprogs`)

into `/usr/sbin` and adding these and the `geopmaccess` command line
tool to the sudoers file.  This enables the user that executes the
tests to execute these four commands without providing a sudo password.
After this is done the `test_su_*.sh` scripts may be run as a non-root
user.

Alternatively these `test_su_*.sh` scripts may be run as the root
user, however, the `geopm/integration` directory must be added to the
root user's `PATH` to enable this.

### Modifications to /etc/sudoers

Example modifications to the `/etc/sudoers` file to enable running
these tests with a non-root user are as follows.  Under the "User
privilege specification" section, add the following:

```bash
# All users can execute these with *no* password
%users  ALL=NOPASSWD: \
            /usr/sbin/check_session_clean.sh,\
            /usr/sbin/get_batch_server.py,\
            /usr/sbin/install_service.sh,\
            /usr/sbin/kill_geopmd.sh,\
            /usr/bin/geopmaccess, \
            /usr/bin/systemctl stop geopm, \
            /usr/bin/systemctl start geopm, \
            /usr/bin/systemctl restart geopm, \
            /usr/bin/systemctl unset-environment GEOPM_DISABLE_IO_URING GEOPM_DISABLE_MSR_SAFE, \
            /usr/bin/systemctl set-environment GEOPM_DISABLE_MSR_SAFE=TRUE, \
            /usr/bin/systemctl set-environment GEOPM_DISABLE_IO_URING=TRUE, \
            /usr/sbin/test_batch_perf, \
            /usr/bin/env GEOPM_DISABLE_MSR_SAFE=TRUE /usr/sbin/test_batch_perf * *, \
            /usr/bin/env GEOPM_DISABLE_MSR_SAFE=TRUE GEOPM_DISABLE_IO_URING=TRUE /usr/sbin/test_batch_perf * *, \
            /usr/bin/chown * test-batch-perf-msr-*-root-*.csv, \
            /usr/sbin/modprobe msr, \
            /usr/sbin/modprobe -r msr
```

### Running the suite

Some of the the tests involve positive and negative testing in the
same file.  Because of this, examining the test output may be
confusing.  To avoid this confusion and to run all of the tests as a
suite, use the following to execute and verify the return codes of all
the tests:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

python3 -m unittest discover \
        --top-level-directory ${GEOPM_SOURCE} \
        --start-directory ${GEOPM_SOURCE}/service/integration/test \
        --pattern 'test_*.py' \
        --verbose
```

If the output of that command ends as follows, the run was successful:
```
<Lots of output from the individual tests>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 140.573s

OK
```

If the output was not as expected, please file an issue on our GitHub
repository.

Where to find other tests
-------------------------

The tests in this directory do not use any of the tools provided by
`libgeopm`.  Integration tests for `libgeopm` derived features are
located in `geopm/integration/test`.  Some of these tests may use the
GEOPM service on a system where it is required.

The unit tests for the C++ files in `geopm/service/src` are located in
`geopm/service/test`.  The unit tests for the C++ files in `geopm/src`
are located in `geopm/test`.  We have split the unit tests in to two
directories so that the service subdirectory is fully independent.

The unit tests for the geopmdpy module are located in
`geopm/service/geopmdpy_test`.
