The NEKBONE proxy application is a benchmark approximating large eddy
simulation calculations and direct numerical simulation of turbulence.
We provide a patch that introduces GEOPM instrumentation and a patch
that optimizes the benchmark for Xeon Phi.  Along with the patches we
provide instructions for downloading the benchmark and applying the
patches.
