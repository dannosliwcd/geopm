The miniFE benchmark is a proxy application for finite element
analysis using a conjugate-gradient algorithm on a sparse linear
system without preconditioning.  We provide a patch that introduces
GEOPM instrumentation and a patch that optimizes the benchmark for
Xeon Phi.  Along with the patches we provide instructions for
downloading the benchmark and applying the patches.
