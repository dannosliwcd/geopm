Shell Completion Scripts
========================
This directory contains scripts to enable shell completion for GEOPM Service
tools.

The non-extension part of each file name indicates which tool's interface is
autocompleted by the script. The extension part of the file name indicates the
target completion environment. For example, geopmread.bash defines a Bash
autocompletion script for geopmread.

Typically, these scripts can be enabled by sourcing them into your shell
environment or by installing them to a location where they will be automatically
sourced. For example, you can add `source /path/to/geopmread.bash` to your
`.bashrc`.
